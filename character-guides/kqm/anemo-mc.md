## Preface 

Despite being the first playable character of the game, Anemo MC is often very underrated as both a DPS and Support character. While any character can be thrown into DPS showcases with high enough investment, Anemo MC has a lot of important utility that can amplify the overall output of a lot of teams in addition to their solid individual damage.  
  
It should also be stated that Anemo MC under no circumstances should be treated like a 5 _or expected to perform on the level of 5_ Supports or main DPS characters. Their base stats are too low, their ascension stat is Atk% as opposed to Crit, and their utility isn’t quite on the level of characters such as Venti or Zhongli. Nonetheless, Anemo MC is still a very strong character that can provide a lot to a team.

## Weapons

The first most important factor in deciding what weapon to use is based on if you have **enough ER to cast Gust Surge off cooldown**. Anemo MC’s Elemental Burst is their **most important talent** and if that can’t be used off cooldown the best choice is to opt for an **ER substat weapon**. Personally, I would recommend **avoiding this and aiming for ER substats** if anything. If this is not an issue, opt for a more DPS oriented weapon.   
  
The listed order will be for more DPS oriented weapon priority:

1. Primordial Jade Cutter
2. Summit Shaper **\(5 Stacks, Shielded\)**
3. Blackcliff Longsword **\(3 Stacks\)**
4. Summit Shaper
5. Lion’s Roar **\(Passive Active\)**
6. Aquila Favonia
7. Blackcliff Longsword **\(1 Stack\)**
8. Harbinger of Dawn R5 **\(Passive Active\)**
9. Alley Flash **\(Passive Active\)**
10. The Black Sword
11. Lion’s Roar
12.  Prototype Rancour **R2**
13. Iron Sting
14. Harbinger of Dawn
15. Festering Desire

**Note: Options 2 and 3 are unrealistic to upkeep and are primarily in the list for comparison sake.**

## **Talents and Talent Priority**

### Talent Priority 

Elemental Burst: **Gust Surge** &gt; Elemental Skill: **Palm Vortex** &gt; Normal Attack: **Foreign Ironwind**

### Normal Attack

The generic Normal Attack Talent. For Anemo MC, the Normal Attacks are slow and honestly not worth investing into or spending field time doing.

### Elemental Skill: Palm Vortex

Anemo MC's Elemental Skill has 2 different methods of dealing damage. The first is **Tap Skill** , which has a 5 second cooldown and does a single instance of Anemo damage. While its multiplier isn’t the biggest, being on low cooldown allows **Tap Skill** to be spammed for decent damage over time. **Tap Skill** creates 2 Anemo particles.  


The second method is **Hold Skill**. This ability takes significant field time but it provides multiple damage instances and more damage than the **Tap Skill**. A max **Hold Skill** will result in an 8 second cooldown and generate **3 or 4 particles**. **Hold Skill** can be stopped before max hold, resulting in less cuts, but also less field time, cooldown, and between **2 and 3 particles**. The damage for **Hold Skill** can be broken down into 4 different types of damage: cuts, infused cuts, swirl, and blast. Elemental infusion is dependent on the element on Anemo MC. If none exists, then infusion depends on the element on the enemies hit by Palm Vortex.  


Cut damage is the 6 small Anemo damage ticks that occur while pulling enemies into Palm Vortex. Their damage isn’t phenomenal, but it's not negligible. The 6 infused cuts are identical to cut damage but at a lower talent multiplier and require a ****Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro aura ****existing on either Anemo MC or one of the enemies. This deals damage of the infused element’s type. The 2 swirl procs from the **Hold Skill** result from the interaction between cuts and infused cuts. This damage is calculated based on **Elemental Mastery and Anemo MC's Level**, not from stats. The 1 instance of blast damage is the same type of damage as the **Tap Skill** variant except at a larger multiplier. The blast damage also has knockback which can be used to abuse fall damage against enemies next to walls.  
****

### Elemental Burst: Gust Surge

Gust Surge is the bread and butter of a strong Anemo MC build. It might also be referred to as a **Tornado** or **Blender**. The damage for Gust Surge can be broken down into 3 different types of damage: blends, infused blends, and swirl. Elemental infusion is dependent on the element on Anemo MC. If none exists, then infusion depends on the element on the enemies hit by Gust Surge.

Blend damage is damage from the Anemo ticks of the tornado itself. There are 9 instances of this damage and they do significant damage. The 9 infused blends are identical to blend damage but at a lower talent multiplier and require Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro existing on either Anemo MC or one of the enemies. This deals damage of the infused element’s type. The 3 swirl procs from Gust Surge result from the interaction between blends and infused blends. This damage is calculated based on **Elemental Mastery and Anemo MC's Level**, not from stats.

There are also some interesting interactions with Anemo MC’s tornado. First, it can be stopped in place by a solid object such as a wall or Geo Construct. Larger enemies and geo shields do not count. Second, it can pick up deployables such as Xiangling’s Guoba or Amber’s Baron Bunny, which can be effective in providing a strong Melt or Vaporize combo with either of these in a Cryo or Hydro infused tornado.

### Ascension 1: Slitting Wind

Adds an extra no-hitlag Anemo attack to the end of the Normal Attack string. The damage from this ability is non-negligible but it isn’t enough to warrant auto attacking with Anemo MC.

### Ascension 4: Second Wind

This talent provides a small heal upon killing an enemy with Palm Vortex. It heals back 2% of Anemo MC’s health every second for 5 seconds after getting a kill for a total of 10% heal. This heal is still in effect when Anemo MC is off field but it is not worth going out of your way to get a kill with Palm Vortex to make use of the passive.  


## Constellations 

### C1: Raging Vortex

This constellation adds a lot of utility to **Hold Palm Vortex** by adding a 5m radius pull. This can enable **Hold Skill** to hit more enemies and adds extra grouping ability to Anemo MC.

### C2: Uprising Whirlwind

This constellation provides a bonus 16% Energy Recharge to Anemo MC which can help regen Gust Surge much easier.

### C3:  **Sweeping Gust**

Increases the level of Gust Surge by 3. This is just a simple DPS increase to Anemo MC's Elemental Burst. 

### C4: **Cherishing Breezes**

This constellation isn’t super important but it provides a little bit of extra tankiness when using **Hold Palm Vortex**.

### C5: Vortex Stellaris

Increases the level of Palm Vortex by 3. This is just a simple DPS increase to Anemo MC's Elemental Skill. 

### **C6: Intertwined Winds**

This constellation is by far the most important constellation for Anemo MC, and in my opinion, one of the most underrated constellations in the game. It provides **20% Anemo resistance shred** to enemies hit by Gust Surge and an additional **20% resistance shred to the infused element** if that’s applicable. This means 60% resistance shred to Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro is possible all in a single character if using the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set. The only other place this is possible is on C6 Venti which is not attainable for most players, so an F2P option for high resistance shred is quite nice. The **20% resistance shred** from this constellation lasts **10 seconds** so it is possible for 100% resistance shred uptime as long as the tornado hits an enemy at least 5 seconds after it is cast.

## Playstyles 

There are two primary playstyles for Anemo MC, **DPS** and **Support**. Moving towards endgame, specifically beyond AR50, the **Support** build should become a higher priority with **DPS** main and substats.

### DPS

DPS Anemo MC is not a sustained carry on field that uses the Normal Attack talent. The Normal Attack talent is simply too low damage and wastes too much field time to make use of in mid to end game comps. The DPS build is specialized in amplifying Palm Vortex and Gust Surge damage and ideally tries to maximize damage in as little field time as possible. This means you should be using tap Palm Vortex often and cast Gust Surge  off of cooldown. This build is more oriented to quickswap playstyles with well-invested teams and high team damage output.

### Support

Support Anemo MC is the recommended build but it falls out of relevance in comps without a Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro DPS character. This build uses a mix of tap Palm Vortex, infused hold Palm Vortex, and infused Gust Surge to keep up resistance shred while also dishing out considerable damage. Anemo MC’s personal damage will not be as high as the DPS variant but this build enables far more team damage. The 4 piece Viridescent Venerer set is highly recommended due to the ability to reach 60% shred, but if you are running a comp without a Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro DPS character and are insistent on running Anemo MC, the 4 piece Noblesse Oblige set or a DPS set will be fine.

## Team Compositions 

A team should never be built around Anemo MC. Instead, Anemo MC should be looked toward as filling in 3rd or 4th slots on teams as a potential Support or sub DPS character. However, there are specific teams and characters that Anemo MC pairs very well with.

### Any Pyro/Cryo/Hydro/Electro Team

Slotting Anemo MC into a team like this is a great idea because it enables the most benefit from the C6 effect and the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set. Anemo MC can provide these teams a massive boost to damage \(38.89% dps increase to infused element vs a 10% resist enemy\) and is effective in place of other anemo supports such as Venti or Sucrose.

### Xiao

Anemo MC is a strong support to a Xiao carry team due to being a rare and F2P source of Anemo resistance shred, providing Anemo particles to battery Xiao, and providing Anemo resonance to the team. As an added bonus, Xiao’s Elemental Skill, Lemniscatic Wind Cycling,  after a normal jump can reach mobs inside Anemo MC’s tornado, meaning you can make strong use of the grouping.

### Zhongli 

Zhongli is an exceptional enabler to Anemo MC because of the pillar and bonus 20% shred. Not only does Zhongli buff Anemo MC’s damage, but he also increases the resistance shred overall provided to the team. The pillar can be used to stop Anemo MC’s Q and have it spin in place, which is useful for heavy mobs that can’t be pulled and for keeping small enemies close to you.

### Ningguang

Ningguang is listed here as the same reason as Zhongli for his pillar. The edges of her jade screen can also stop Anemo MC’s Gust Surge in place.

### **Geo MC \(CO-OP Only\)**

Geo MC is listed for the same reason as Zhongli for his pillar. The Elemental Skill, Starfell Sword, can also stop Anemo MC’s Gust Surge in place.
